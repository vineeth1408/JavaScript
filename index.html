            <p class="h2">Since we do social works; while envisioning for FTP - we thought of making this a colorful place - full of diversity and inclusion. Where everyone have their voice heard and their place understood, in the human society and encourage and support what they can gift society through their service.
                So for everyone here, who have come from different backgrounds, FTP always looked for and encouraged - to build bonds and share their life experiences between employees.
                And since many are from different walks of life, FTP always wanted to help employees in their personal and professional growth, and support them in their development. For making this happen, we have become a <i>learning organization,</i> wherein everyone can learn from anyone, anytime, anywhere.
                For that to happen we employees of this organisation should be happy and efficient. In this light, we shall begin creating a learning culture and environment.
                As part of this we are announcing a brand-new  initiative <b>FTP-GROWTH CLUB</b>, which hosts full of productive, fun-filled, engaging & entertainment Activities.
                Above all this development initiative will also focus on personalised individual development.
